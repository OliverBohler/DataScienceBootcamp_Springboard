# 🚲 LA Metro BikeShare Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

The **LA Metro BikeShare Analysis Project** focuses on evaluating **bike station performance, trip patterns, and multimodal transportation integration**. The goal is to provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving station placement, increasing ridership, and optimizing infrastructure within **Downtown LA and the Westside regions**.

This project uses **geospatial analysis, predictive modeling, and transit data integration** to enhance bike share accessibility and efficiency. The insights generated will support **infrastructure planning, multimodal transportation strategies, and investment decisions** for Metro BikeShare.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

To understand the project workflow, **start with the Project Proposal**:

1. **Project Proposal (`project_proposal.md`)**
   - Defines the problem statement and objectives.
   - Explores the role of **bike share in urban mobility**.
   - Identifies key research questions, including **station demand forecasting** and **integration with public transit**.

## 📊 Data Processing & Cleaning

The **Data Cleaning** step ensures data integrity and prepares it for analysis. Key steps include:

### 1️⃣ **Data Collection & Integration**
   - Combines datasets from:
     - **Metro BikeShare trips**
     - **Bike station geolocation data**
     - **Weather conditions from Santa Monica Airport**
     - **LA Metro transit schedules and ridership data**
   - Standardizes date and time formats for **trip analysis**.

### 2️⃣ **Handling Missing & Inconsistent Data**
   - Identifies missing values in:
     - **Start/end station coordinates**
     - **Trip durations**
     - **Bike availability data**
   - Uses **imputation techniques** where feasible.

### 3️⃣ **Feature Engineering**
   - **Time-based variables**: Rush hour flags, weekday vs. weekend usage.
   - **Weather impact analysis**: Matching trips with historical weather conditions.
   - **Station categorization**: Grouping stations based on usage frequency.

### 4️⃣ **Outlier Detection & Removal**
   - Identifies unrealistic trip durations (e.g., trips over 6 hours).
   - Detects incorrect geospatial entries.

## 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The **EDA** phase uncovers key insights into bike share usage trends, station demand, and multimodal connectivity.

### 1️⃣ **Trip Volume & Usage Patterns**
   - Identifies **peak usage hours** and busiest days.
   - Compares **Downtown LA vs. Westside station demand**.
   - Analyzes **seasonal variations in bike share ridership**.

### 2️⃣ **Station Performance Analysis**
   - Maps **high and low-performing stations**.
   - Evaluates **trip start vs. trip end imbalances**.
   - Identifies underutilized stations for **potential relocation**.

### 3️⃣ **Multimodal Integration**
   - Examines connectivity between **bike share stations and LA Metro stops**.
   - Evaluates the impact of **bus/train proximity on bike share usage**.

### 4️⃣ **Weather & External Factors**
   - Assesses the impact of **rainfall and temperature on ridership**.
   - Explores correlation between **special events and bike trip spikes**.
